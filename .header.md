# terraform-runtask-iam-access-analyzer

Use this module to integrate HCP Terraform Run Tasks with AWS IAM Access Analyzer for policy validation.

![Diagram](./diagram/RunTask-EventBridge.png)

## Prerequisites

To use this module you need have the following:

1. AWS account and credentials
2. HCP Terraform with Run Task entitlement (Business subscription or higher)

## Usage

* Build and package the Lambda files

  ```
  make all
  ```

* Refer to the [module_workspace](./examples/module_workspace/README.md) for steps to deploy this module in HCP Terraform.

* After you deployed the [module_workspace](./examples/module_workspace/README.md), navigate to your HCP Terraform organization, go to Organization Settings > Integrations > Run tasks to find the newly created Run Task.

* You can use this run task in any workspace where you have standard IAM resource policy document. Refer to the [demo_workspace](./examples/demo_workspace/README.md) for more details.

## Limitations

1. Does not provide verbose error / warning messages in Run Task console. In the future, we will explore possibility to provide verbose logging.

2. Does not support Terraform [computed resources](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/schemas/schema-behaviors).

For example, the tool will report no IAM policy found for the following Terraform template. The policy json string is a computed resource. The plan output doesn't contain information of IAM policy document.

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
  name        = "test-policy"
  description = "A test policy"

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.b.id}"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

## Best practice

* **Do not** re-use the Run Tasks URL across different trust-boundary (organizations, accounts, team). We recommend you to deploy separate Run Task deployment per trust-boundary.

* **Do not** use Run Tasks URL from untrusted party, remember that Run Tasks execution sent Terraform plan output to the Run Task endpoint. Only use trusted Run Tasks URL.

* Enable the AWS WAF setup by setting variable `deploy_waf` to `true` (additional cost will apply). This will add WAF protection to the Run Tasks URL endpoint.

* We recommend you to setup additional CloudWatch alarm to monitor Lambda concurrency and WAF rules.
