# Usage Example

**IMPORTANT**: To successfully complete this example, you must first deploy the module by following [module workspace example](../module_workspace/README.md).

## Attach Run Task into Terraform Cloud Workspace

Follow the steps below to attach the run task created from the module into a new Terraform Cloud workspace. The new workspace will attempt to create multiple invalid IAM resources. The Run tasks integration with IAM Access Analyzer will validate it as part of post-plan stage.

* Use the provided demo workspace configuration.

  ```bash
  cd examples/demo_workspace
  ```

* Change the org name in with your own Terraform Cloud org name.

  ```
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your Terraform Cloud org name.
      organization = "<enter your org name here>"
      workspaces {
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }   
  ```

* Populate the required variables, change the placeholder value below.
  ```bash
  echo 'tfc_org="<enter your org name here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'aws_region="<enter the AWS region here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'runtask_id="<enter the Run Task ID output from previous module deployment>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'demo_workspace_name="<enter the new demo workspace name here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  ```

* Initialize Terraform Cloud. When prompted, enter the name of the new demo workspace as you specified in the previous step.
  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

* Configure the AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in Terraform Cloud, i.e. using variable sets. [Follow these instructions to learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started/cloud-create-variable-set).

* In order to create and configure the run tasks, you also need to have Terraform Cloud token stored as Variable/Variable Sets in the workspace. Add `TFE_HOSTNAME` and `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable to the same variable set or directly on the workspace.

 * Enable the flag to attach the run task to the demo workspace.
   ```bash
   echo 'flag_attach_runtask="true"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
   terraform apply
   ```

* Navigate back to Terraform Cloud, locate the new demo workspace and confirm that the Run Task is attached to the demo workspace.

## Test IAM Access Analyzer using Run Task

The following steps deploy simple IAM policy with invalid permissions. This should trigger the Run Task to send failure and stop the apply.

* Enable the flag to deploy invalid IAM policy to the demo workspace.
  ```bash
  echo 'flag_deploy_invalid_resource="true"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  ```

* Run Terraform apply again
  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

* Terraform apply will fail due to several errors, use the CloudWatch link to review the errors.
