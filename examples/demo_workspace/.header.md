# Usage Example

**IMPORTANT**: To successfully complete this example, you must first deploy the module by following [module workspace example](../module_workspace/README.md).

## Attach Run Task into HCP Terraform Workspace

Follow the steps below to attach the run task created from the module into a new HCP Terraform workspace. The new workspace will attempt to create multiple invalid IAM resources. The Run tasks integration with IAM Access Analyzer will validate it as part of post-plan stage.

* Use the provided demo workspace configuration.

  ```bash
  cd examples/demo_workspace
  ```

* Change the org name in with your own HCP Terraform org name. Optionally, change the workspace name.

  ```hcl
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your HCP Terraform org name.
      organization = "wellsiau-org"

      # OPTIONAL: Change the workspace name
      workspaces {
        name = "AWS-Runtask-IAM-Access-Analyzer-Demo"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ```

* Populate the required variables, change the placeholder value below.

  ```bash
  echo 'tfc_org="<enter your org name here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'aws_region="<enter the AWS region here>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'runtask_id="<enter the Run Task ID output from previous module deployment>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  echo 'demo_workspace_name="<enter the same workspace name as in your terraform - cloud block>"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  ```

* Initialize HCP Terraform.

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

* We recommend configuring dynamic credentials to provision to AWS from your HCP Terraform workspace or organization. [Follow these instructions to learn more.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/aws-configuration)

* In order to create and configure the run tasks, you also need to have HCP Terraform token stored as Variable/Variable Sets in the workspace. Add `TFE_HOSTNAME` and `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable to the same variable set or directly on the workspace. ![TFC Configure Variable Set](../diagram/TerraformCloud-VariableSets.png?raw=true "Configure HCP Terraform Variable Set")

* Enable the flag to attach the run task to the demo workspace.

   ```bash
   echo 'flag_attach_runtask="true"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
   terraform apply
   ```

* Navigate back to HCP Terraform, locate the new demo workspace and confirm that the Run Task is attached to the demo workspace. ![TFC Run Task in Workspace](../../diagram/TerraformCloud-RunTaskWorkspace.png?raw=true "Run Task attached to the demo workspace")

## Test IAM Access Analyzer using Run Task

The following steps deploy simple IAM policy with invalid permissions. This should trigger the Run Task to send failure and stop the apply.

* Enable the flag to deploy invalid IAM policy to the demo workspace.

  ```bash
  echo 'flag_deploy_invalid_resource="true"' >> tf.auto.tfvars
  ```

* Run Terraform apply again

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

* Terraform apply will fail due to several errors, use the CloudWatch link to review the errors. ![HCP TF Run Task results](../../diagram/TerraformCloud-RunTaskOutput.png?raw=true "Run Task output with IAM Access Analyzer validation")
