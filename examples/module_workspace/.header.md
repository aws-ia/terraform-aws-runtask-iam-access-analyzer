# Usage Example

First step is to deploy the module into dedicated HCP Terraform workspace. The output `runtask_id` is used on other HCP Terraform workspace to configure the runtask.

* Build and package the Lambda files using the makefile. Run this command from the root directory of this repository.

  ```bash
  make all
  ```

* Use the provided module example to deploy the solution.

  ```bash
  cd examples/module_workspace
  ```

* Change the org name to your TFC org.

  ```hcl
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your HCP Terraform org name.
      organization = "<enter your org name here>"
      workspaces {
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ```

* Initialize HCP Terraform. When prompted, enter a new workspace name, i.e. `aws-ia2-infra`

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

* Configure the new workspace (i.e `aws-ia2-infra`) in HCP Terraform to use `local` execution mode. Skip this if you publish the module into Terraform registry.

* Configure the AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) by using environment variables.

* In order to create and configure the run tasks, you also need to have HCP Terraform token stored as Environment Variables. Add `TFE_HOSTNAME` and `TFE_TOKEN` environment variable.

* Run Terraform apply

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

* Use the output value `runtask_id` when deploying the demo workspace. See example of [demo workspace here](../demo_workspace/README.md)
